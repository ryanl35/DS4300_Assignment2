# FooCycle

According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in the United States alone, Americans waste $160 billion of food, which is nearly 30 to 40 percent of the entire U.S. food supply. At the same time, one in eight Americans struggle to put enough food on the table.

## Mission Statement
To promote food sustainability by encouraging food waste reduction and facilitating food exchange.

## What it does
Foocycle allows users to post about unwanted food items or leftovers within communities. Community members can see the food postings within any community, browse through, and will be able to contact other uses for food they might be interested in. For businesses that have extra food to sell before closing, FooCycle connects individuals to tasty meals that otherwise would not have been sold, creating an extra revenue stream and eco-friendly branding for your restaurant. FooCycle helps enhance supply chains in the food industry, connecting donors with consumers

## How it's built
FooCycle is split up between back-end and front-end components. The back-end architecture we chose was MongoDB, a NoSQL database. MongoDB is great for scalability, especially for the large amount of data that we are going to have, and omits using schemas. The front-end architecture we chose was Flask, which is a front-end framework based in JavaScript that allows users to build their user interface and design their web applications.

## Future Applications
There is much more functionality and scalability for the project in its future. We would like to implement in-app communication to enable users to coordinate how to arrange pickups or inquire about the food product within the app, rather than using external forms of contact.
