ideas:

-delete community, user, and post functions. 

-add invalid key constraints to each function

-have verification approval done manually in a mongodb collection and have it be checked in the add_user function. 
	For example, we could have a pymongo collection with names and approval statuses and we could fetch the verification status from there
	when users make a post or add themselves to the database

-make all_users display more user-friendly 

-add constraint to add_community in case a zip code exists already

-username/password logins? session management?
